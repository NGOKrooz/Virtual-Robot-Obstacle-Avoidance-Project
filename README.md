Project Title:
"Virtual Robot Simulator: Obstacle Avoidance Using Python"

📜 Project Description:
You will simulate a robot moving inside a 2D environment (like a maze or an open room)
The robot will detect "virtual obstacles" (walls, objects) based on proximity.
It will turn left, turn right, or move forward based on the situation.
Everything will happen inside a Python graphical window on your laptop.

🛠 Tools You’ll Need (all free, only software):
Python 3.10+ (install latest)
pygame (for 2D graphics simulation)
math (Python's math functions)
✅ No motors, no sensors, no Raspberry Pi needed.

🔥 What You'll Learn by Doing This:
How robots use sensor data (even if virtual) to make decisions.
How to code movement logic (forward, left, right).
How to detect collisions and avoid obstacles.
Basics of simulation — an important skill for robotics and AI!

✨ Project Flow:
Step
Action
1
Create a robot object (as a small circle or rectangle)
2
Create a "map" (walls, obstacles as rectangles)
3
Program robot movement (up, down, left, right)
4
Add "virtual sensors" to detect if something is close
5
If the robot senses an obstacle ahead, it changes direction
6
Display everything on a pygame window
