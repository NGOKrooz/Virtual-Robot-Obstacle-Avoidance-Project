# Virtual-Robot-Obstacle-Avoidance-Project
You will simulate a robot moving inside a 2D environment (like a maze or an open room).   The robot will detect "virtual obstacles" (walls, objects) based on proximity.   It will turn left, turn right, or move forward based on the situation.   Everything will happen inside a Python graphical window on your laptop.
